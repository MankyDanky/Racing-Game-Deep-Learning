# Racing-Game-Deep-Learning
A racing game in which generations of cars learn to maneuver around a race track.
I created a game where cars can only rotate left or right, and made a set of cars that are always moving forward. I assigned a neat neural network to each of them and created a fitness function. Then I trained the cars, and saved it as winner.pkl, but if you wanna train them yourselves thats fine aswell.
